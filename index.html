                So I created this simple webpage to tell my story.
                (A 2-minute video couldn't cut it!)<br><br>
                I think it's impossible to condense a human's complexities into a webpage, but this is my attempt
                at storytelling why I think I'm a great fit for the program.
                I hope you care to listen (or I guess in this case read, until I implement voiceover technology.
                Maybe after a coding school, I can put that up, but for now, let's read.)

    <div class = "wholepage" id = "problem">
      <h1>The pitch</h1>
      <p> I love tech, especially because of its potential to reach a huge mass of people and improve developing economies.
          I want to grow the tech economy in the Philippines. Product management will help me ship my ideas
          and give me appropriate training and confidence to start a company of my own. But also,
          I love how it infuses the things I'm passionate about into one generalist role. I hope through working as a designer,
          and eventually software engineering, I can get a better understanding of how to transition into product management.</br></br>
          I work in a robotics startup as a designer, also learning basic frontend. I love my role but am frustrated that I do not have enough
          technical knowledge to help build. Additionally, I love the mindset of the engineers I work with -- never giving up until
          they solve a problem and I want to carry the same resilience.</br></br>
          To help me in my path, I think it's important I know how to communicate technically, build my resilience
          as a problem solver and learn how to build things of value to others.

    <div class = "wholepage" id = "why">
      <h1>So.. why Horizons?</h1>
      <p> I discovered my interest in tech late in the game when it was too late to switch majors. Even then,
          I talked to my CompSci friends about the major and how they wished it was more practical.
          I love my school, and while theory is suuuper important, I wanted to BUILD THINGS OF VALUE.
          I had been searching for a way to learn coding or programming in a practical way for a while now--
          visited a bunch of bootcamps in SF, read through many reviews online, etc. Horizons appealed to me most because:

              <img class = "icon" src = "assets/pics/community.png">
              <p> <strong> A strong and young community. </strong>Community is extremely important to me and I think being
                  in this environment of SUPER COOL and passionate kids (based on testimonies from curren students) will push me in unimaginable ways.
                  I admire that it's one of the few programs I know that reels in a younger generation, not just the working population.

              <p> <strong>More than just coding. </strong>80% of the time coding. 20% of the time meeting AMAZING leaders in the tech industry. There's a strong
                  emphasis on creating the next generation of entrepreneurs, not just people who can write code. What a great investment
                  on young people.

              <img class = "icon" src = "assets/pics/bootcamp.png">
              <p> <strong>Emphasis on school, less a bootcamp. </strong>A big critique of coding bootcamps is that they only teach their students how to get a job. When I was interviewing,
                  I was told that there were classes and lessons that emphasized algorithms and data structures, lessons integral for software engineering.
                  The format may be bootcamp-style, but the "school" part was heavily emphasized.

                  despite being the design, HTML and CSS guru, I still have a huge frustration of not understanding the more technical side of things.
                  My coworkers taught me React and Redux, I implemented a feature and it was so fulfilling -- I wanted more! I saw an email
                  about this and I immediately wanted in.

      <h1>What's the most important turning point in my life thus far?</h1>
      <h4>Leaving home.</h4>
      <p> When I got the letter about the <a href = "http://www.wesleyan.edu/international/academic/freeman.html"> Freeman Asian Scholarship for Wesleyan,</a> I cried. Not tears of joy.
          I got the scholarship late and by then I was deadset to study in a really good local university under the Management Engineering track.
          I was scared of leaving home behind and venturing into this foreign jungle.
          If I had stayed, I would have probably taken the corporate route. Would have gotten a lot of money, sure.
          But maybe would have never gotten a taste of what it meant to live out my passion.
          I am so happy I took the plunge.<br><br>
          My freshman year was DIFICULT! I maybe called my dad up and cried to him almost every week that fall semester.
          I had to adjust to a new culture (collectivist > individualistic, conservative > liberal),
          a new lifestyle (HS > college) AND a new school (and a very liberal school at that)!<br><br>
          But, as our diversity leader tells us: "Lean into discomfort." It was hard, but without it, I wouldn't be the empathetic, self-aware person I am today.
          And I wouldn't have discovered my passion in technology and in uplifting the Philippines.
          Being away from home only pushed me closer towards it. I saw the possibilities of tech in other countries
          and now I want to find a way to thread it back to my home, the place I love most.

          <li>Loved the small startup environment and the creation of nothing into something and the necessity of design in tech.</li>
