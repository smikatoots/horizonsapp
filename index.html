                So I created this simple webpage to tell you more stories.
                (A 2-minute video couldn't cut it!)<br><br>
                I hope you care to listen (or I guess in this case read, until I implement voiceover technology.
                Maybe after a coding bootcamp, I can put that up, but for now, let's read.)
                First, mind this egg over here, for a little throwback to something I just submitted.
            <br><br>Done?
            <br><br>Okay.
            <br><br>Cool!

      <h1>So.. why Horizons?</h1>
      <p> I had found out my interest in tech late in the game and by then, it was too late to switch majors. Even then,
          I talked to my CompSci friends and about the major and how they wish it was more practical.
          I love my school, and while theory is suuuper important, I wanted to BUILD things.
          I had been searching for a way to learn coding or programming in a practical way for a while now--
          visited a bunch of bootcamps in SF, read through many reviews online, etc. And Horizons appealed to me most because:

              <img class = "icon" src = "assets/pics/community.png">
              <p> <strong> A strong and young community. </strong>Community is extremely important to me and I think being
                  in this environment of SUPER COOL and passionate kids will push me in unimaginable ways.
                  Admire that it's one of the few programs I know that reels in a younger generation, not just the working population.

          <div id = "code" class = "secondgrid">
              <img class = "icon" src = "assets/pics/code.png">
              <p> <strong>More than just coding. </strong>80% of the time coding. 20% of the time meeting AMAZING leaders in the tech industry. There's a strong
                  emphasis on creating the next generation of entrepreneurs, not just people who can write code. What a great investment
                  on young people and entrepreneurs.

              <img class = "icon" src = "assets/pics/bootcamp.png">
              <p> <strong>Emphasis on school, less a bootcamp. </strong>A big critique of coding bootcamps is that they only teach their students how to get a job. When I was interviewing,
                  I was told that there were classes and lessons that emphasized algorithms and data structures, things
                  I think are important to learn for software engineering. The format may be bootcamp-style, but the "school" part
                  of was very much emphasized.

              <p> <strong>Greaaaaat timing. </strong>I'm interning in a Robotics company doing UX/UI Design, and working with amazing engineers. I love my job, but,
                  despite being the HTML and CSS guru, I had a huge frustration of not understanding the more technical side of things.
                  They taught me React and Redux and I implemented a feature and it was so fulfilling -- I wanted more! I saw an email
                  about this and I immediately wanted in.

          <li>Loved how the nature of the job valued a lot of hard work (check!) and the need to be a generalist (double check!).</li>
          <li>Knew I had to start a company of my own one day, especially one that helped the Philippines.</li>
          <li>Continuing to discover what problems are worth solving and what ideas are worth pursuing.</li>

      <h1>My technology story?</h1>
          <li>Did not start writing code or building my own computer since I was 12 years old.</li>
          <li>Studied in a science high school and learned basic Computer Science but in a very monotonous, non-exciting way.</li>
          <li>Felt very discouraged about ever learning how to code and how I could use it practically, coming into college.</li>
          <li>Did not take a CompSci class.</li>
          <li>Got introduced to the concept of Human-Centered Design. Adore the philosophy!</li>
          <li>Joined the ASES Philippines week-long summit and slowly got brainwashed by the President about how tech was the future.</li>
          <li>Was already interested in starting businesses during my sophomore summer. Tried to start a food franchising business. Failed.</li>
          <li>Was taken in by the founder of this food franchise as a mentee. Worked in his side project health technology startup. </li>
          <li>Loved the small startup environment and the creation of nothing into something and the necessity of design in tech.</li>
          <li>Sat in my friend's Python CompSci classes. Took the University of Austin: Intro to Programming Coursera course.</li>
          <li>Met Filipino tech entrepreneurs and saw the growing potential of tech to solve problems in the Philippines.</li>
          <li>Interned in a tech startup in Denmark that created wind meters. Was introduced to UX/UI Design and Product Management.</li>
          <li>Determined to get involved in UX/UI and Product Management.</li>
          <li>Built my design portfolio -- designed interfaces for 2 startups and redesigned the Philippine domestic terminal airport through user research.</li>
          <li>Got an offer from Lending Club. Got "laid off" by Lending Club due to internal problems, just two weeks before I was to fly off to the Bay.</li>
          <li>Hustled and luckily found an edtech startup teaching kids how to code through robotics!</li>
          <li>Will learn technical skills in Horizons in a year (please?)</li>

      <h1>What's the most important turning point in my life thus far?</h1>
      <p>Don’t fucking lie to yourself. Never let your guard down by thinking you’re fucking good enough. What’s important is the fucking drive to see a project through no matter what. When you sit down to work, external critics aren’t the enemy. It’s you who you must to fight against to do great fucking work. You must overcome yourself. A good fucking composition is the result of a hierarchy consisting of clearly contrasting elements set with distinct alignments containing irregular intervals of negative space. Why are you fucking reading all of this? Get back to work. Never, never assume that what you have achieved is fucking good enough. While having drinks with Tibor Kalman one night, he told me, &ldquo;When you make something no one hates, no one fucking loves it.&rdquo; Someday is not a fucking day of the week. Design as if your fucking life depended on it. Think about all the fucking possibilities. Remember it’s called the creative process, it’s not the creative fucking moment. To surpass others is fucking tough, if you only do as you are told you don’t have it in you to succeed. Saul Bass on failure: Failure is built into creativity… the creative act </p>
